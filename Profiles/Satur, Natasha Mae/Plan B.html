    <h1>Exploring My Alternative Future</h1>
  </header>
  <p>
    If someone asks me what I wanna be in the future if I weren’t destined to be a registered nurse, this would be my answer. 
    I have never considered pursuing anything other than a degree as a registered nurse. However, if being a nurse isn’t meant for me, i’m going to choose a business that suits for this trend.
    This would give me the opportunity to continue my future if weren’t destined to be a registered nurse and it will make me interest.
