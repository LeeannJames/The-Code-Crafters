    <p>During Pre-Med:<br><br>
	1.	Explore Parallel Healthcare Careers:<br>
If you’re realizing early that medicine may not be the right fit, explore alternative careers in healthcare, like physician assistant (PA), nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy, or public health.<br>
	2.	Pursue Research Opportunities:<br>
If you’re interested in science, you can shift your focus toward biomedical research or clinical trials. This could lead to advanced degrees like a Master’s or PhD.<br>
	3.	Broaden Your Academic Focus:<br>
Use electives to explore other fields you might enjoy, such as psychology, bioinformatics, or business, which could provide alternative pathways.<br>
	4.	Consider Related Fields in Science:<br>
If you’re strong in the sciences, other careers like biotechnology, genetics counseling, or lab sciences could be worth exploring.<br><br>

After Graduation:<br>
	1.	Post-Baccalaureate Programs:<br>
If your academic performance isn’t competitive enough for medical school, you can consider post-bacc programs to strengthen your credentials.<br>
	2.	Graduate School Options:<br>
Consider pursuing a Master’s in Public Health (MPH), healthcare administration (MHA), or other science-related fields that align with your interests.<br>
	3.	Alternative Careers in Healthcare:<br>
Non-clinical roles like medical writing, healthcare consulting, health tech, or hospital administration might appeal to you.<br>
	4.	Take a Gap Year:<br>
Use this time to gain experience through volunteering, shadowing, or working in healthcare-related roles to refine your goals and improve your application if you still want to pursue medicine.<br>
	5.	Pivot to a Different Field:<br>
Skills from a pre-med background can transfer to many other fields like education, sales.<br></p>
