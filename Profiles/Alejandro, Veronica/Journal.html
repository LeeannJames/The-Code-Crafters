      If someone ever asks me what I think I would become in the future if I weren’t destined to be a registered nurse, this would be my answer. 
      I have never considered pursuing anything other than a degree as a registered nurse. However, if being a nurse isn’t meant for me, I think I would choose to have my own business, either a coffee shop or a restaurant. 
      This path would give me the opportunity to enjoy life and have more time for my personal interests.

    <h2>Entry 1: A New Beginning</h2>
    <p class="date">December 17, 2024</p>
    <p>Today, I decided to start my journal. I'm excited to keep track of my thoughts and experiences here.</p>

    <h2>Entry 2: A Quiet Day</h2>
    <p class="date">December 18, 2024</p>
    <p>This afternoon was one of those rare moments when everything felt calm and unhurried. After finishing my morning tasks, I decided to spend some time by myself. The weather was cloudy.</p>
    <p>I sat down with a book I've been meaning to finish. The story took an unexpected turn, and I couldn't put it down. It made me think about how life, like stories, can be unpredictable yet full of meaning. I found myself underlining a few quotes that really resonated with me.</p>
    <p>Around mid-afternoon, I brewed a cup of coffee. While sipping it, I called an old friend. We caught up on life, shared a few laughs, and even made tentative plans to meet after the holidays.</p>
    <p>Today wasn't about big accomplishments, but about finding joy in the small, quiet moments. I'm glad I took the time to slow down.</p>
