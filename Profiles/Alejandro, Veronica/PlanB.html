      If someone ever asks me what I think I would become in the future if I weren’t destined to be a registered nurse, this would be my answer. 
      I have never considered pursuing anything other than a degree as a registered nurse. However, if being a nurse isn’t meant for me, I think I would choose to have my own business, either a coffee shop or a restaurant. 
      This path would give me the opportunity to enjoy life and have more time for my personal interests.
