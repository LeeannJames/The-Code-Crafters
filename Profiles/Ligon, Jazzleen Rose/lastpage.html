            <h2>What I've Learned In GE Electiive Subject</h2>
            <p>What I learned at GE Electric was how to encode HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to actually use them, especially when working with BSD.<br><br>
                <b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b> is used to create web pages using elements such as headings, paragraphs, and links. With HTML, you learn about the different types of HTML elements and how to use them.<br>
                <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> are used to change the appearance of web pages, such as colors, fonts, and layouts. With CSS, you can enhance and organize your web page.<br>
                <b>JavaScript</b> is used to make web pages interactive, such as handling click events and understanding basic programming concepts like variables and functions.<br><br>
                In this subject, I learned a lot. I learned how to code and create a website, add fonts and colors, and make it interactive. I gained new knowledge through this. When I did activities using BSD, I became interested in it. This subject is easy if you really study it, and it’s also fun to code in BSD.<br><br>
                Even though I had a hard time at first because I didn’t know how to use it and couldn’t understand it, I eventually started enjoying it. I'm still wondering, though, what the connection between coding and my nursing course is. Can we really use it? But I also thought that the world is changing now, with a lot of trendy equipment using technologies. Maybe in the near future, computers will be integrated into almost all of our equipment.</p><br>
