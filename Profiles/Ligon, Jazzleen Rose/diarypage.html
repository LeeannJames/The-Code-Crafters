        <h1>WHAT AM I IF Iâ€™M NOT PURSUING NURSING</h1>
        <hr>
        <p><b>What am I if I'm not a nursing student?</b><br><br> 
            Maybe I am a student studying in a university whose course is Bachelor of Science in Agribusiness (BSAb) because I tried to take an exam in that university whose supposed course is Bachelor of Science in Biology (BSBio), but I didn't pass.<br>
            I didn't continue taking that course because it wasn't the course I really wanted. I was hesitant at first if I would take my slot in that course because I know it is expensive to be a nursing student, but this is the course I pursued because it has always been my dream.<br><br>
            Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management (BSHM) and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration major in Marketing Management (BSBA MKTG) are also one of the courses I'm trying to take because I don't know where to study Nursing.<br>
            If I weren't pursuing nursing, I'd probably be spending my time stressing over math on CLSU because I passed the entrance exam and landed on Agricultural Business, I hate math, personally so I would be struggling to pass this semester right now had I not gotten the chance to enter this prestigious school, <br>
            I think no matter what course/program you pick, it'll always be hard, the only difference you can get is when you loved your picked course because no matter how difficult something is, as long as you find purpose and love doing it, you will always prevail and pursue it, and be fulfilled with every progress you make along the way.<br>
            If I am a student who has completed the Bachelor of Science in Agribusiness (BSAb) course, I will explore what jobs are possible that are covered by my completed course. I will save money and persevere to study Nursing and fulfill this dream of mine because I really wanted it when I was a child.<br>
            If I were to be asked, the only course I really want to take is the nursing course, and I don't want to take anything else.<br><br>
            I also plan that after I finish school, I want to go abroad. I want to go to Japan first because that is my dream to go to. I want to experience their tradition and culture; I want to live there and try their food. Also, I also want to go around every place there; their environment is clean and disciplined, which is why I want to visit that country. Travel to different places and countries because this is one of my passions.</p>
