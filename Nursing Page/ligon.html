            <h2>What did I learn in my course?</h2>
            <p>Since I entered this course, I learned a lot—I realized a lot—that college life is very different from high school life. The amount of changes, the amount of adjustment I made because I was shocked—this is how life is as a college student.</p>

            <p>But what did I learn? I learned to balance the time because of the amount of study that needs to be done every day and every night. I learned to master a lot of things, especially in anatomy and physiology; you have to learn every part of a person's body. I also learned not to sleep and go home without rest because of the activities and exams that also need to be finished on time.</p>

            <p>But despite this, I can't blame myself either because I liked it. No matter how hard it is, you have to make your dreams come true. Because if you don't believe in yourself that you can do it, nothing will happen to you. Sometimes I think, Is this really the beginning of my life? That's it, because the life I have someday depends on it.</p>

            <p>Add to this, that what I have learned is enough? My answer is no, because I am just starting. I still have a lot to learn in the course I entered; there are so many things I want to learn, such as how to take care of a patient.</p>

            <p>Also, how does it feel to be on duty at the hospital and interact with the patients? Plus, what else does a nurse do in the hospital? Even if they say that nursing is hard, if you want and love it, and if you are ready to fight for the dream you have, even if it is this difficult, it will be fought for you to fulfill your dreams.</p>
