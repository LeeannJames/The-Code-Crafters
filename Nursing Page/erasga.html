        <h1>My Nursing Journey</h1>
        <p>What I learned in nursing school is to build a strong personality and
            especially a presence of mind; you need to carry it every day. Because
            you're saving someone else's life. And of the most importance is being
            an independent person, because you're able to stand on your own when
            you care for a patient. I realize every subject I have taken in
            nursing school is very crucial because it points to someone else's
            life, and it was very serious when it was talked about. You need to
            focus and learn it anyway. You need to love your course deeply because
            it will lead you to be more knowledgeable than you'll expect. And I
            want to learn more in this course about disease, about first aid and
            more to save and to help someone sick. I want to be a part of people
            that help someone who needs help.</p>
