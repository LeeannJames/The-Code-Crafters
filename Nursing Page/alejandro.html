        <h1>My Nursing Journey</h1>
        <p>When I think about my journey in nursing, I realize it’s not just about learning facts or passing exams—it’s about growing as a person. Nursing has a way of teaching you about life, people, and even yourself in ways you don’t expect.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest things I’ve learned is that nursing is never just about treating symptoms. It’s about understanding people. It taught me that the best care is about helping people take care of themselves, not just stepping in to fix things.</p>
        <p>What I didn’t expect was how much nursing would teach me about resilience. Patients I’ve learned about, and even classmates I’ve worked with, have shown me how strong people can be in the face of challenges. That’s been one of the most inspiring parts of this journey so far. It’s also pushed me to grow in how I handle challenges in my own life, to face them with patience and determination.</p>
        <p>For me, nursing isn’t just a career. It’s a way to understand life, to connect with people, and to make a difference in ways both big and small. Every new lesson brings me closer to the kind of person and nurse I want to be, and I can’t wait to keep growing.</p>
